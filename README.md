# # PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview

The main purpose of this analysis was to perform an exploratory analysis on data in .csv files and create several types of visualisations using Pandas and Matplotlib. The data consisted of two files. The first one contained information about city name, drivers count and city type. The second one had city name, date, fare and ride id. Two data sets were merged, then calculations were performed to find the corelations and patterns in data and graphs were created to visualize findings.


## Results


For better understanding the data, the following visualisations were made:

1) Total Ride Count by City Type

![Fig2](https://github.com/AlekseiPronin/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig2.png)

The average number of rides in rural cities is 4 times less then in urban cities and almost 3.5 times less then in suburban cities. Urban cities have the most rider count.

2) Average Fares by City Type

![Fig3](https://github.com/AlekseiPronin/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig3.png)

The average fare for rides in the rural cities is about $11 and $5 more per ride than the urban and suburban cities, respectively.

3) Driver Count by City Type

![Fig4](https://github.com/AlekseiPronin/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig4.png)

The average number of drivers in rural cities is nine to four times less per city than in urban and suburban cities, respectively.

4) As a final task, we were asked to make a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type for the 1st quarter of the year.

![PyBer_Fare_Summary](https://github.com/AlekseiPronin/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)

The urban cities showed the best result among all city types, showing total weekly fares above $1600 during the whole period. Rural cities weekly fares did not exceed $500 except for 1 week in april.



## Summary

Based on the findings we could suggest the CEOs of the company the following:

1) According to the correlation between number of drivers and profit, increasing the number of drivers in rural cities will increase the total number of rides and will bring new profit.

2) There is also a strong negative correlation between fare size and weekly profit. Considering that, decreasing the fares in rural cities may bring more profits, because rides may become more affordable.

3) Considering that urban cities make the most of all rides of the company, have most number of drivers and make most profit for the moment, CEOs may consider charging extra fee for mileage in the cities. Even the slight charge increase will bring more extra profit.
